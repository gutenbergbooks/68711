at 47° below zero; wine freezes at 20°; sea water freezes at 28.3°.
Alcohol has been exposed to 110° and 120° below zero without freezing.
Granite decomposes at a red heat. The second’s pendulum, of 39.139 ins.
is lengthened by 30° of temperature 128th of an inch, or 3 vibrations

How Money Accumulates.


The following shows how easy it is to accumulate a fortune, provided
proper steps are taken. The table shows what would be the result at the
end of fifty years by saving a certain amount each day and putting it
at interest at the rate of six per cent:

  _Daily Savings._  _The Result._
  One cent           $    950
  Ten cents             9,504
  Twenty cents         19,006
  Thirty cents         28,512
  Forty cents          38,015
  Fifty cents          47,520
  Sixty cents          57,024
  Seventy cents        66,528
  Eighty cents         76,032
  Ninety cents         85,537
  One dollar           95,041
  Five dollars        375,208

Nearly every person wastes enough in twenty or thirty years, which, if
saved and carefully invested, would make a family quite independent;
but the principle of small savings has been lost sight of in the
general desire to become wealthy. By the way, would you like to get
a famous book telling how to get rich? We have published a book of
54 great secrets, and will send it postpaid with 11 other books (12
volumes in all) on receipt of only ten cents. Address your order to
Keystone Book Co., P. O. Box 1634, Philadelphia, Pa. Each of the books
referred to above is excellently printed and sure to give satisfaction.




Interesting Facts.


The Atlantic Ocean includes an area of 30,000,000 square miles. Suppose
an inch of rain to fall upon only one-fifth of this vast expanse, it
would weigh 360,000,000 tons, and the salt which, as water, is held
in solution in the sea, and which, when the water was taken up as a
vapor, was left behind to disturb the equilibrium, weighed 16,000,000
more tons, or nearly twice as much as all the ships in the world could
carry at a cargo each. It might fall in a day; but occupy what time it
might in falling, this rain is calculated to exert so much force--which
is inconceivably great--in disturbing the equilibrium of the ocean.
If all the water discharged by the Mississippi River during the year
were taken up in mighty measure, and cast in the ocean at an effort,
it would not make a greater disturbance in the equilibrium of the sea
than the fall of rain supposed. And yet so gentle are the operations of
nature that movements so vast are unperceived. Another interesting fact
is that you can get a beautiful garnet and opal ring absolutely free.
This great offer is made by a reliable firm to introduce their goods.
Send twelve cents in stamps to W. S. Everett & Co., 113 Munroe Street,
Lynn, Mass., requesting them to mail you a sample of their celebrated
Perfumery, and they will mail free with it a beautiful garnet and opal
ring. Send them strip of paper showing size around your finger.

Values of Old Coins, Stamps, Etc.


Are you aware that there are in circulation hundreds of dates and
varieties of coins which could be sold to coin brokers at rates in
excess of their par value? These brokers purchase the coins to sell
to coin collectors (numismatists) most of whom are wealthy, and when
anxious for certain dates or kinds to complete their sets, they
sometimes pay enormous prices, even offering as high as $5,000 for a
certain U. S. coin of 1848. It often happens that coins which seem to
be very common are wanted by the brokers, and if the ones who handle
such only had a reliable list, they could ascertain their real value.
Only a short time since the daily newspapers contained a statement
about how a shoemaker took a coin in change, as ordinary money, and
happening to be in the habit of comparing his coins with a Coin Manual,
he found that this piece was valuable, and sold it the next day for
$1,100. Even recent dates are sometimes valuable, for instance,
quarters and half dollars of 1853 are worth from $5 to $10, a cent of
1856 brings $3, but we cannot undertake to give further examples as
there are hundreds of them. Many people have become rich by keeping
their eyes open for old coins, why not you? The best places to find
them are in the country districts. Numerous Canadian and other foreign
coins are worth big sums. We might also add that similarly high prices
are paid for old stamps taken from envelopes that have been through the
mails. Even the most common kind are saleable in quantities, and if
you get the best book of prices of stamps, you will find that there is
no humbug in the oft-repeated story of the “value of a million stamps”
or even a single stamp, oftentimes. In order to get fully posted get
the two most reliable coin and stamp books. They contain information
more reliable than any that you can find elsewhere. Both books are
revised right up to this month and contain the names and addresses of
reliable coin and stamp brokers with whom you can deal. Although the
books may be worth many dollars, perhaps a fortune to you, we will
send both volumes, postpaid, on receipt of only ten cents, silver or
stamps. Send your order for these books to the U. S. Supply Co., Box
329, Lynn, Mass. Although you may obtain these books any time during
the next twenty years, it may be best to send at once so as to lose no
opportunities.




Statistics of the Globe.


The earth is inhabited by about 1,500 million of inhabitants, viz:

  Of the Caucasian race    460,000,000
  Of the Mongolian         550,000,000
  Of the Ethiopian         190,000,000
  Of the Malay             300,000,000
  Of the American Indian     1,000,000

There are about 3,064 languages spoken in the world, and its
inhabitants profess more than 1,000 different religions. The number of
men is about equal to the number of women. The average of human life
is about 33 years. One-quarter die previous to the age of 7 years,
one-half before reaching 17, and those who pass this age enjoy a
felicity refused one-half of the human species. To every 1,000 persons,
only 1 reaches 100 years of life; to every 100, only 6 reach the age
of 65; and not more than 1 in 500 lives to 80 years of age. There
are on the earth 1,000,000,000 inhabitants; of these 33,333,333 die
every year, 91,824 every day, 3,730 every hour, and 60 every minute,
or 1 every second. The married are longer lived than the single, and
above all, those who observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall men
live longer than short ones. Women have more chances of life in their
favor previous to their being 50 years of age than men have, but fewer
afterward. The number of marriages is in the proportion of 75 to every
1,000 individuals. Marriages are more frequent after the equinoxes,
that is, during the months of June and December. Those born in the
spring are more robust than others. Births and deaths are more frequent
by night than by day. The number of men capable of bearing arms is
calculated at one-fourth of the population.




The Origin of Postage Stamps.


The origin of the postage stamp had a tinge of romance in it. It was
thirty-seven years ago that Rowland Hill, while crossing a district in
the north of England, arrived at the door of an inn where a postman
had stopped to deliver a letter. A young girl came out to receive
it; she turned it over and over in her hand and asked the price of
postage. This was a large sum, and evidently the girl was poor, for the
postmaster demanded a shilling. She sighed sadly and said the letter
was from her brother, but that she had no money, and so she returned
the letter to the postman. Touched with pity, Mr. Hill paid the postage
and gave the letter to the girl, who seemed very much embarrassed.
Scarcely had the postman turned his back, when the young inn-keeper’s
daughter confessed that it was a trick between her and her brother.
Some signs on the envelope told her all she wanted to know, but the
letter contained no writing. “We are both so poor,” she added, “that we
invented this mode of corresponding without paying for the letters.”
The traveler, continuing his road, asked himself if a system giving
rise to such frauds was not a vicious one? Before sunset Rowland had
planned to organize the postal service upon a new basis--with what
success is known to the world.
